*This repository is deprecated and won't be updated anymore. It now lives on the [[https://gitlab.com/vdemeester/home][~home~]] repository (on Gitlab)*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My emacs setup is tested to work only with emacs 26.1 and newer versions. If you are on
older versions, I would recommend that you upgrade to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][latest available stable version]].
#+END_QUOTE

*Warning: this repository is being /transformed/ a bit: slowly migrating to literate programming ([[./emacs.org][emacs.org]]) and most likely moving into [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home][=home=]] at some point*

* Few notes

- This works best in =NixOS=, coupled with my [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home][=home=]] repository (especially with my
  [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home/blob/master/modules/profiles/emacs.nix][emacs.nix]] file).
- Almost all setup files have setup done as per my personal tastes and needs.
- If you want to change the default theme, font size, etc, you would want to edit
  =setup-files/setup-style.el=

* Key points

- Use of my minor mode =vde-mode= to enable my custom key-bindings. Doing so allows me to
  force override my bindings in all major and minor modes. If I ever need to try out the
  default emacs bindings, I can simply disable =vde-mode= by doing =M-x vde-mode=. /It
  is enabled globally by default./
- Use of =use-package= in load all packages for faster load times.
- Use of =bind-keys= allows me to review my custom bindings in a single buffer by doing
  =M-x describe-personal-keybindings=.
- Certain packages will be loaded only if you have the associated applications installed.

* Feedback

Use at your own risk, but I am definitely looking forward to suggestions, corrections.

Thanks!
